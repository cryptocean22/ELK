# Elastic Certified Engineer Exam
# 1. Nodes, Shards, Replicas and Cluster 

| Term | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Node** | A single server in Elasticsearch that stores data and handles search and indexing operations. |
| **Index** | A collection of documents that share the same structure and are stored together. |
| **Shard** | A smaller portion of the index; Elasticsearch divides an index into shards for scalability. |
| **Replica** | A copy of a shard; ensures data availability and improves search performance. |
| **Cluster** | A group of nodes working together to manage and store data as one unit. |

## 1.1. How Elasticsearch handles nodes, shards, replicas
**Example 1:**

```KQL
PUT testindex {
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
```
- Total shards are calculated as:
  - `Total Shards = Primary Shards x (1 + Number of Replicas)`
  - `Total Shards = 1 x (1 + 0) = 1`

- There is one node in this example. A node is a single instance of Elasticsearch.
- Each index in Elasticsearch is divided into primary shards to distribute data for scalability.
  - Here, there is 1 primary shard (P1) for the index _testindex_.
- Replicas are copies of primary shards for redundancy and fault tolerance.
  - In this example, the number of replicas is set to 0, meaning no replica shard exists.
- The index contains only the primary shard (P1), with no replicas. All data resides on a single node.
- The configuration uses the PUT request to define the number of primary shards (number_of_shards: 1) and replicas (number_of_replicas: 0):


**Example 2:**
![](https://github.com/cryptocean22/ELK/blob/main/Certifications/ELastic-Certified-Engineer/Pictures/Bildschirmfoto%202024-12-07%20um%2020.49.13.png?raw=true)

```KQL
PUT testindex2 {
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 2,
    "number_of_replicas": 1
  }
}
```
- Total shards are calculated as:
  - `Total Shards = Primary Shards x (1 + Number of Replicas)`
  - `Total Shards = 2 x (1 + 1) = 4`

- The setup has 2 nodes, meaning two Elasticsearch instances that can store and process data.
- The index (testindex2) is divided into 2 primary shards (P1 and P2), ensuring that the data is distributed across nodes.
- Each primary shard has 1 replica (P1R1 for P1 and P2R1 for P2).
  - Replicas are placed on a different node from their corresponding primary shard to ensure fault tolerance.
- Node 1: Stores P1 (primary shard) and P2R1 (replica shard of P2).
- Node 2: Stores P2 (primary shard) and P1R1 (replica shard of P1).


**Example 3:**
![](https://github.com/cryptocean22/ELK/blob/main/Certifications/ELastic-Certified-Engineer/Pictures/Bildschirmfoto%202024-12-07%20um%2020.49.30.png?raw=true)

```KQL
PUT testindex2 {
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```
- Total shards are calculated as:
  - `Total Shards = Primary Shards x (1 + Number of Replicas)`
  - `Total Shards = 3 x (1 + 2) = 9`

- There are 3 nodes, meaning three Elasticsearch instances. The shards are distributed across these nodes.
- Each primary shard has 2 replicas. For example:
  - P1 has replicas P1R1 and P1R2.
	- P2 has replicas P2R1 and P2R2.
	- P3 has replicas P3R1 and P3R2.
- Elasticsearch automatically distributes primary and replica shards across nodes for fault tolerance and performance.
- Each node holds a mix of primary and replica shards. For example:
  - Node 1: Holds P1, P2R1, P3R1.
	- Node 2: Holds P2, P1R1, P3R2.
	- Node 3: Holds P3, P1R2, P2R2.

## 1.2. Elasticsearch Index Health and Shard Configuration
### 1.2.1. Health Status Basics
Elasticsearch index health is determined by the status of **primary** and **replica shards**:

- **Green**: All primary and replica shards are assigned.
- **Yellow**: All primary shards are assigned, but some or all replica shards are unassigned.
- **Red**: One or more primary shards are unassigned.

### 1.2.2. Scenarios
**1. Default Index Creation**
Command:
```KQL
PUT employees
```
- Default Settings:
  - number_of_shards: 1
  - number_of_replicas: 1

- Result:
  - Elasticsearch creates:
    - 1 primary shard
    - 1 replica shard
  - If thereâ€™s only one node, the replica cannot be assigned and remains unassigned.
- Health Status: Yellow
  - Reason: The primary shard is active, but the replica shard is unassigned.

**2. Index with Custom Shard Settings**
```KQL
PUT employees
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
```
- Default Settings:
  - number_of_shards: 1
  - number_of_replicas: 0

- Result:
  - Elasticsearch creates:
    - 1 primary shard
    - 0 replica shard (explicitly set to 0)
  - Since there are no replicas to assign, the cluster is fully operational.
- Health Status: Green
  - Reason: All primary shards are active, and no replicas are expected.

## 2. Elasticsearch CRUD Operations 
### 2.1. Overview of CRUD Operations 
| Operation  | HTTP Method | API Endpoint Example              | Purpose                                 |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Create** | `POST`      | `POST my_index/_doc/1`            | Adds a new document to an index.        |
| **Read**   | `GET`       | `GET my_index/_search`            | Retrieves data by ID or query.          |
| **Update** | `POST`      | `POST my_index/_update/1`         | Modifies fields of an existing document.|
| **Delete** | `DELETE`    | `DELETE my_index/_doc/1`          | Removes a document from an index.       |


```KQL
POST my_index/_doc/1
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "occupation": "Data Analyst"
}

GET my_index/_doc/1

GET my_index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "occupation": "Data Analyst"
    }
  }
}

POST my_index/_update/1
{
  "doc": {
    "age": 26
  }
}

DELETE my_index/_doc/1
```
